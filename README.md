# Academic-Progression-Tracker-using-Python
 I built a Python program for predicting academic progression in university students based on credit scores. Staff can input pass, defer, and fail credits for multiple students. It determines progression outcomes accurately, handles errors, and includes a histogram visualization. Student data is stored in a text file.
